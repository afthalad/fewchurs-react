# Fewchurs for React and Next.js

A feature-request board in any React app: install, add one env var, render one component.
Server-rendered in Next.js with the API key kept on the server, or client-side in a Vite/CRA SPA.

```bash
pnpm add @fewchurs/next    # Next.js App Router
pnpm add @fewchurs/react   # any other React app
```

| Package | What it is | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| [`@fewchurs/react`](packages/react) | Fetch client, store, hooks, components, styles | Any React 18 or 19 app |
| [`@fewchurs/next`](packages/next) | Server-rendered board, route handler, server actions, cookie identity | Next.js 14+ App Router |

## Next.js

```dotenv
FEWCHURS_API_KEY=fr_live_…
```

```ts
// app/api/fewchurs/[...route]/route.ts
export { GET, POST, DELETE } from "@fewchurs/next/handler";
```

```tsx
// app/feedback/page.tsx
import { FewchursBoard } from "@fewchurs/next";
import "@fewchurs/next/styles.css";

export default function Page() {
  return <FewchursBoard />;
}
```

The board renders on the server with real data. Voting, commenting and submitting post to your
own route handler, which adds the key — so the key is never in the client bundle, and no CORS
is involved.

`<FewchursBoard>` is a server component (it imports `server-only`). Importing it from a
`"use client"` file is a build error rather than a key silently serialized into the browser
bundle.

## React SPA

```tsx
import { FewchursBoard, FewchursProvider } from "@fewchurs/react";
import "@fewchurs/react/styles.css";

export function App() {
  return (
    <FewchursProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_FEWCHURS_KEY}>
      <FewchursBoard />
    </FewchursProvider>
  );
}
```

The key is publishable here, the same way it is in the mobile SDKs — protection is server-side
rate limiting, not secrecy. This mode needs CORS on the Fewchurs API. Until that ships, point
the provider at a proxy instead and keep the key on your own server:

```tsx
<FewchursProvider baseUrl="/api/fewchurs">
```

## Hooks

```tsx
const { features, isLoading, error, loadMore, hasMore } = useFeatures({ sort: "top" });
const { hasVoted, upvoteCount, toggle, isPending } = useVote(featureId);
const { comments, add, loadMore } = useComments(featureId);
const { submit, isPending } = useSubmitFeature();
const { isFollowing, follow, unfollow } = useFollow(featureId);
const { feature, isLoading, refresh } = useFeature(featureId);
const { showBranding, hideVoteCounts } = useFewchursConfig();
```

Hooks never throw on a failed request. Every failure is a typed value:

```ts
type FewchursError =
  | { code: "invalid_key"; status: 401; message: string }
  | { code: "validation_failed"; status: 400; message: string }
  | { code: "rate_limited"; status: 429; message: string }
  | { code: "not_found"; status: 404; message: string }
  | { code: "limit_reached"; status: 402; message: string }
  | { code: "server"; status: number; message: string }
  | { code: "network"; message: string };
```

`userMessage(error)` returns a sentence that is safe to show a visitor.

## Customization

**Level 1 — defaults.** `<FewchursBoard />` renders tabs, the list, voting, comments, the submit
form, and the Fewchurs badge when the app is on a plan that shows it. Light and dark follow
`prefers-color-scheme`, and the first paint is placeholder rows shaped like the cards, so the
board keeps its height instead of jumping when the first page lands.

**Level 2 — CSS variables.**

```css
.fewchurs {
  --fw-primary: #ed5f18;
  --fw-radius: 12px;
  --fw-font: var(--font-sans);
  --fw-surface: #fff;
}
```

or `<FewchursBoard theme={{ primary: "#0f766e", radius: 4 }} />`.

**Level 3 — props.**

```tsx
<FewchursBoard
  tabs={["top", "new", "roadmap"]} // default: ["top", "new"]
  defaultTab="top"
  showDeclined={false}
  allowComments
  emailField="optional"
  pageSize={20}
  initialFeatureId={requestId} // shows that one request above the list
  labels={{ title: "Ideas", submit: "Suggest an idea" }}
/>
```

**Level 4 — slots.**

```tsx
<FewchursBoard
  renderHeader={() => <MyHeader />}
  renderEmpty={() => <MyEmpty />}
  renderFeature={(feature, actions) => (
    <MyRow feature={feature} onVote={actions.toggleVote} />
  )}
/>
```

**Level 5 — headless.**

```tsx
<FewchursBoard.Root>
  <FewchursBoard.Tabs />
  <FewchursBoard.List />
  <FewchursBoard.SubmitTrigger />
</FewchursBoard.Root>
```

`unstyled` drops every class name and keeps behaviour, ARIA and keyboard handling. Or skip the
components entirely and build your own UI on the hooks.

Slots and `onEvent` are functions, so they cannot be passed to the Next.js server component.
Wrap the client board in your own `"use client"` file when you need them.

## A button that slides the board in

`FewchursBoardDialog` wraps the board in a modal, so a "Feedback" button anywhere in the app
can open it. It takes every `FewchursBoard` prop, plus `open` and `onClose`. Escape closes it,
clicking the backdrop closes it, and focus returns to whatever opened it.

```tsx
const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

<button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Feedback</button>
<FewchursBoardDialog open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} />
```

It is a client component, so in Next.js render it from your own `"use client"` file with
`FewchursProvider baseUrl="/api/fewchurs"` around it.

## Linking to one request

`initialFeatureId` shows one request above the list with its comments already open — for a link
from an email or a changelog straight to what someone voted on. `@fewchurs/next` renders that
request on the server too. An id that no longer exists is ignored: the list still shows.

```tsx
<FewchursBoard initialFeatureId={new URLSearchParams(location.search).get("request") ?? undefined} />
```

`useFeature(featureId)` fetches one request on its own, into the same store the lists use, so
voting or commenting on it updates everywhere at once.

## Identity

Votes are anonymous and tied to an `X-Device-Id`.

- **Next.js** — an `httpOnly` cookie, set by the route handler on the first request. The server
  and the browser agree, so there is no hydration mismatch.
- **SPA** — a cookie when same-origin, `localStorage` as a fallback, generated on first use.
- **Signed-in users** — hash the user id so votes follow the account across devices:

```tsx
<FewchursProvider deviceId={hashedUserId}>
```

```ts
export const { GET, POST, DELETE } = createHandler({
  deviceId: async () => hash((await auth()).userId),
});
```

Always hash. Never send a raw id or an email address as the device id.

## Analytics

```tsx
<FewchursProvider onEvent={(event) => track(event.name, event)}>
```

Events: `boardOpened`, `featureSubmitted`, `voted`, `commented`, `followed`, `error`.

## Repo layout

```
packages/react   the client package
packages/next    the Next.js package
examples/next-app   server-rendered board, route handler, no key in the bundle
examples/vite-spa   client-only board, publishable key or dev-server proxy
```

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test          # vitest + MSW + Testing Library
pnpm build         # tsup → ESM + CJS + types
pnpm size          # bundle budget
pnpm check:packaging   # publint + are-the-types-wrong
```

## Requirements

React 18 or 19. Next.js 14+ (App Router) for `@fewchurs/next`, Node 20+ for its route handler,
which also runs on the edge runtime. No runtime dependencies — React is a peer dependency, and
the styles are a plain stylesheet with no Tailwind or CSS-in-JS requirement.
